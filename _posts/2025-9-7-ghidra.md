## Ghidra 

### What is Ghidra
Ghidra is a reverse engineering tool for decompiling from a binary file. This reverses the binary file into C code, but the limitation is that from the compiling and assembling process, the binary file loses the names of its variables and maybe even its functions. Therefore, it would be harder to point out which variables are for what.</br> 
To install Ghidra, simply go to the GitHub page for Ghidra, choose a release version, and download and unzip the necessary files into either your C Drive or another drive if you do not have the space. Then click on the executable file, which is a batch file, to run it.</br>
You should also read through the requirements for that specific version of Ghidra, like what version of Java it needs and its technical requirements on memory.</br>
When you open Ghidra, the first thing to do is to create a New Project on the top left in the File > New Project section. Once done, you can then click on Import File to import a binary file into that project (or multiple binaries if clicking on Batch Import).</br>
After that, it would ask for more information about the binary:</br>
- Format: The format options would be ELF or only binary. ELF means that it has a more organized structure, with sections for code, local and global uninitialized or initialized variables. Binary means that it is simply binary.</br>
- Language: This is for what compiler was used for the binary file.</br>
