# Weekly CTF 5
Here, we are setting up a VM and the proxy on the VM to do our attacks on the vulnerable VMs. 

# What to set up?
1. Creates a VM and install Chrome via the terminal. Devtools are included in Chrome.

2. Install FoxyProxy extension and create a proxy.

3. Install Burp Suite as well.

4. Add Burp Suite certification to the FoxyProxy proxy.

5. Install Postman on the terminal and create an account. Postman is for testing APIs.

6. Add in a new proxy to FoxyProxy so traffic is either redirected to Postman or BurpSuite depending on what you want to do.


# Postman vs Burp Suite
Postman let you see the entire web API in the big picture while you can interact with all end hosts

Burp Suite let you only see, test and attack one end host.


# Tomorrow
There will be a full in-person CTF.
