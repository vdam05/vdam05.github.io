# Docker 
Docker is a container-management platform. Containers are lightweight applications that share the host's kernel to operate, along with having their required libraries and operating system features (including environmental variables). Containers also run in isolated environments. Since containers share the kernel, the kernel version or type also matter to whether or not they can run. 

Rather than installing the dependencies and configuring for that application, Docker does so for you quickly with a few commands with the built-in CLI.

- The container also has a Dockerfile, which is similar to the concept of a Bash script but it is for automating the installation and configuration of libraries and variables needed for the application to work properly. *In the Dockerfile, it starts with the keyword 'FROM' followed by an OS version. This tells Docker to install the image, that is the application code for that OS but not the kernel.*
- Images are the application, dependencies and scripts needed. But the container is what runs that image. 
- Docker Scout can do vulnerability scanning on images and give you a list of vulnerabilities from the libraries used and also their CVSS score (which is risk measurement) and CVE identification.
