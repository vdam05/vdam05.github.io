# Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
EDR is used for protecting your device against real-time threats. It can perform threat hunting, posture checking and overall analyze malwares with greater depth than your typical firewall. It can also hunt malwares by signatures, which are essentially the patterns in code of how certain attacks look like. Another key difference between a firewall and an EDR is that a firewall is for trying to prevent bad traffic from getting into your device while an EDR finds malwares that resides in the traffic, which bypass that first layer of defense, and gets into your device already.

# Installing a home EDR
Here, I am going to be using a free EDR here, which is OpenEDR, for learning purposes and also home use. The link for installing the EDR is at [openedr_installation](https://www.openedr.com/)
