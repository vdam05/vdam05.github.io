# Weekly CTF 12
We are doing picoCTF challenges related to forensics.

# Secrets of the Polygot

After we download the file, we could do the command `binwalk` onto the file to find the secrets of file. We see that there is a png file on top of the pdf file. That is why we could not open the pdf file normally since there is that png file in front of it when we look at the output of binwalk.

To deal with the png, I go to `FotoForensics` at https://www.fotoforensics.com/ and see that the image contains the first half of the flag. Or I could copy that file into another file ending with `.png` and then open it.

Then for the second half, I go to any pdf opening website and use it to open the pdf to get the second half of the flag. 

# DISKO1

For this one, we are given a zip file. After unzipping it, we have the file called `disko-1.dd`. 

This is a disk image file. To get any information out of it, we can use the command `strings` to find human-readable strings, but it will output a lot of text.

So we could use it with `grep` to find `pico` for the flag like this:

    strings disko-1.dd | grep "pico"
