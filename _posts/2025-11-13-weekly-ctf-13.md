# Weekly CTF 13
Today, we are just going over some Linux commands like `grep` and doing some picoCTF challenges.

## First Grep

This is just introduction to `grep`. After downloading the file, you can do:

    cat file | grep "picoCTF"

to find the flag inside the file, which consists of a very long string in 1 line.

## Sleuthkit
It is your best friend when it comes to digital forensics. Has a lot of commands for your need.

## Sleuthkit Intro

After downloading the file with `wget` in `/temp`, we get the disk image called `disk.img.gz`. 

Well, it is zipped first so do `gzip -d` to unzip it. 

Then we use the command `mmls` to display the layout of the disk image (which is a snapshot of the disk content). It has a partition table, some unallocated space, and the Linux disk partition (just a part of the disk). 

Then we look at the `Length` column to get our result. After that, just connect to the instance and put our answer in.

## Sleuthkit Apprentice

Like the Intro, we download it and decompress the file.

First, we will check the directories of that file image with:

    fls -o 2048 disk.flag.img

This will check based on the image offset of sector 2048 which is the start of the first partition. This can be seen in command `file disk.flag.img`.

Then we can give the command for fls an `inode` value which stores the metadata about some directory or files on that partition. If no inode is given, it uses the root directory's inode.

There doesn't seem to be anything on there so we can check the 2nd and 3rd partitions. In the 3rd partition, we get some good results.

After checking the inode in `/root/my_folder` by looking at its inode, we see there is a file with `flag` in its name. We want to get its content:

    icat -o 360448 disk.flag.img 2371

Overall though, `read the Sleuthkit commands and their docs`.
