# Ansible
Ansible is a configuration management tool for automating on many different devices. It uses YAML, which is a form of XML, in its playbooks, which are essentially scripts consisting of commands for what to do on those devices. In addition, you can also group up devices based on IP addresses. Ansible also connects to these devices using SSH from any machine with administrative rights, making it easier to handle.
