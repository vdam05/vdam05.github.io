# Weekly CTF 3
Postman: an application for testing APIs (Application Programming Interface) and also navigating through what the APIs do behind the scene.

APIs: basically servers that do a function for you. In the robots.txt section of a website, you would see different endpoints for that website. They do one specific thing.

# Proxies
Can set up FoxyProxy as the add-on to our browser with similar steps

OR

Could do the manual way of setting up proxy in browser's settings and adding a certificate so that the browser would trust BurpSuite as our proxy.

# Get aHEAD
[Get aHEAD](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/132?page=1&search=Get%20ahead)

In this challenge, looking at the name, we would want to do a HEAD request for the headers, which are the headers of the response. 

We could use Burp Suite to intercept the GET request when we load up the website. Now we are replacing "GET" with "HEAD" instead to do a HEAD request. Then we could forward that packet.

In the HTTP history section, we would see the original request that was done and also the modified request and for both, the response that was received from the modified one. This is where the flag resides.

Or we could use any packet-sending command like curl with the flag --head to do a HEAD request rather than GET.
The command would look like: 
    
    curl --head mercury.picoctf.net:29139/index.php 
    
(--head can also be flag -I. Read the curl documentation for this).
