# Update
It has been like a month from my latest post. I have been studying for the CompTia Security+ exam and today I successfully passed the exam with a score of 793. 

I will be going back to posting more often soon. But if I don't post anything or like rarely, it is either I am stuck on what to post or have been studying for exams.

Cheers.

More updated: I will even write blogs of how I do certain labs for exams. I just did not write for Security+ because
I did not have access to labs.
