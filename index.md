This is the start of my blogs while I am working on cybersecurity topics and projects. 

I made this blogging website via a template for simplicity.

Here is where I officially write about what I learn. This could include several tools I use, progress on projects, CTF challenges, so on. I will be going back to referencing this in the future as well.

For any of these posts, I may be updating what I learn even more about that tool/topic.
