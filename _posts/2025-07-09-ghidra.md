## Ghidra 
You should have some basic C programming language knowledge beforehand such as pointers and variable sizes.
### What is Ghidra
Ghidra is a reverse engineering tool for decompiling from a binary file. This reverses the binary file into C code, but the limitation is that from the compiling and assembling process, the binary file loses the names of its variables and maybe even its functions. Therefore, it would be harder to point out which variables are for what. 
To install Ghidra, simply go to the GitHub page for Ghidra, choose a release version, and download and unzip the necessary files into either your C Drive or another drive if you do not have the space. Then click on the executable file, which is a batch file, to run it.
You should also read through the requirements for that specific version of Ghidra, like what version of Java it needs and its technical requirements on memory.
When you open Ghidra, the first thing to do is to create a New Project on the top left in the File > New Project section. Once done, you can then click on Import File to import a binary file into that project (or multiple binaries if clicking on Batch Import).
After that, it would ask for more information about the binary:

- Format: The format options would be ELF or only binary. ELF means that it has a more organized structure, with sections for code, local and global uninitialized or initialized variables. Binary means that it is simply binary.</br>
- Language: This is for what compiler was used for the binary file.

### How to use Ghidra
Note: I am using an example ELF file with a C compiler.
After opening the file, there may be multiple windows that pop up. The list below could all be accessible via the Window tab.

- Program Trees: This is where it shows the different sections of the ELF file like .bss and .data, where the variables are at.
- Symbol Tree: This would be where you could find the different variables and functions. There are also the libraries that this binary imported or exported. In the Functions tab, one good place to start would be the main function. However, it can have a different name.
- Data Type Manager: This is where you can look at different variable types, such as bytes, strings, or custom objects.
- Bytes: This shows the binary file in hexadecimal form and can also tell the address range.
- Decompile: This is the window that tells you the C code that was decompiled. When first looking at it, it would look very confusing since the original variable names are replaced with names like pbVar1, local_20, etc.
+ The names of the variable can tell you more about that variable
