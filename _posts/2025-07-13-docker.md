# Docker 
Docker is a container-management platform. Containers are lightweight applications that share the host's kernel to operate, along with having their required libraries and operating system features (including environmental variables). Containers also run in isolated environments. Since containers share the kernel, the kernel version or type also matter to whether or not they can run. 

Rather than installing the dependencies and configuring for that application, Docker does so for you quickly with a few commands with the built-in CLI.

# Some things about Docker

- The container also has a Dockerfile, which is similar to the concept of a Bash script but it is for automating the installation and configuration of libraries and variables needed for the application to work properly. *In the Dockerfile, it starts with the keyword 'FROM' followed by an OS version. This tells Docker to install the image, that is the application code for that OS but not the kernel.*
- Images are the application, dependencies and scripts needed. But the container is what runs that image. 
- Docker Scout can do vulnerability scanning on images and give you a list of vulnerabilities from the libraries used and also their CVSS score (which is risk measurement) and CVE identification.
- After clicking the container in the Container tab and go to Inspect, you can see various details about the image run, such as the platform it is in like Linux, the application logs, the environmental variables set when running, the commands to start the application, and the files that it has (this is only accessible after application is running). 
  - The files are in the container's seperate filesystem. For example, in a Linux application, you would see some common directories like /var, /temp, /sys and other dependencies.
- In the Image tab, after clicking on any image, you can see the layers, which are the commands run for building that application. It is seperated into layers since if there is any changes made to the application code, only the commands for updating the application would run. **So Docker would not run every single command every time.**

# Docker commands
For more Docker commands, see [Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/)
In the CLI provided by Docker:
- docker pull <'image_link'> = pulls an image from someone's repository, essentially just getting the files.
- docker run --rm -p <'port-1'>:<'port-2'> image_link = running the container with the path to the image using port forwarding. Here, it means that we map our computer's port (port_1) to Docker's port (port_2). The command --rm means that it would remove the container once we exit out of it.
