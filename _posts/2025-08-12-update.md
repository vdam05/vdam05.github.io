# Update
It has been like a month from my latest post. I have been studying for the CompTia Security+ exam and today I successfully passed the exam with a score of 793. 

I will be going back to posting more often soon. But if I don't post anything, it is either I am stuck on what to post or have been studying for exams.

Cheers.
